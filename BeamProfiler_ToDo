- add conversion from inches to microns, want to be able to add the data in inches and have it convert
- auto update the fit to automatically fit when the data is changed
	*not quite sure where to start on this one
- Make a reset button which clears the data and fit
	*want to make an if else statement inside the push_button function (or similarly named function)
	if reset button was pressed == reinitialize the entire plot, set the data to all zeros and make the plot show up 	
	as it did when start up the GUI, with nothing on it
	else plot the data like it was doing before
- possibly make a conversion button which automatically converts the numbers when pressed
	*this seems like a very easy thing to do, when pressed, multiple all the xdata by 25.4 to convert from inches 1/1000 inch to microns
	(double check this)
- reformat how the buttons look (size, placement, etc)
- add a button which adds in sample data
- if there is more data then the space given in the table, possibly an append function to make it larger
- adding rows and columns on the fly


Changes implemented:
- x and y axes labeled
- previous plot data gets deleted automatically
- shows an example plot, added a button which reverts back the entire plot to 
fitting to sample data
